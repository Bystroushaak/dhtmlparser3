Python version of DHTMLParser. 

= What is it? =
	DHTMLParser is a lightweight parser created for one purpose - quick parsing 
	of selected information, when you know where to look.
	
	It can be very useful when you're writing your own API for a page, or a 
	checker (a script that is continuously checking something on the web and 
	alerts you when the information being checked has been changed).
	
	If you want, you can also create HTML/XML documents much more easily than 
	from a string.

= How it works? =
	The module has just one, important function - parseString(), which takes
	a string and returns a DOM (Document Object Model) made of HTMLElement 
	objects.
	
	The DOM is encapsulated in a container - a blank HTMLElement that holds
	the whole DOM in its .childs property.

= HTMLElement =
|
|++ HTMLElement[] childs
|		If the element has children, they are stored in this property.
|
|++ string[string] params
|		If the element has parametres, you will find them here.
|
|++ HTMLElement endtag
|		In case this tag is an Opener (<p> for example), this variable holds a 
|		link to the closing element (</p>).
|
|++ HTMLElement openertag
|		Analogous to endtag.
|
|
|
|-- HTMLElement[] find(string tag_name, string[string] params = null, 
|                      function fn = null, case_sensitive = False)
|		Same as findAll, but doesn't returns endtags. You can always get them 
|		from .endtag property.
|
|-- HTMLElement[] findAll(string tag_name, string[string] params = null,
|                         function fn = null, case_sensitive = False)
|		One of the most important methods, which handles DOM queries.
|
|		Lets say that you want each link in a page - 'dom.find("a")' will 
|		return an array of links.
|
|		You can also specify parametres or define a lambda function which will 
|		find whatever you want.
|
|-- HTMLElement[] findB(string tag_name, string[string] params = null, 
|                      function fn = null, case_sensitive = False)
|		Same as findAll, but using Breadth-first algorithm 
|		http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search
|
|-- HTMLElement[] findAllB(string tag_name, string[string] params = null,
|                         function fn = null, case_sensitive = False)
|		Same as findAll, but using Breadth-first algorithm 
|		http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search
|
|
|
|-- bool isTag()
|		Returns true if the element is a tag (closed in <>). Comments aren't 
|		tags!
|
|-- bool isOpeningTag()
|		Returns strue if element have .endtag (is closed).
|
|-- bool isEndTag()
|		Returns true if closing tag. 
|
|-- bool isEndTagTo(HTMLElement opener)
|		Returns true if this element is an end tag </tagname> for given element.
|
|-- bool isNonPairTag()
|		Returns true if nonpair tag (<br /> for example).
|
|-- void isNonPairTag(bool isnonpairtag)
|		Setter which allows setting whether this element is nonpair. 
|
|-- bool isComment()
|		Returns true if this element is an HTML comment (<!-- -->).
|
|-- bool isAlmostEqual(self, tag_name, params = None, fn = None, 
|                      case_sensitive = False)
|		Compare element with given tagname, params and/or by lambda function.
|
|		Lambda function is same as in .find().
|
|
|
|-- string __str__()
|		String representation of this element, same as prettify().
|
|-- string prettify()
|		Returns prettified HTML output with childs (full document).
|
|-- string tagToString(original = False)
|		Returns a string representation if tag, without childs.
|
|		If original == True, returns original string from which element was 
|		parsed, so if you changed something in .params, there will be no traces
|		of those changes.
|
|-- string getTagName()
|		Tagname - <a href="bla"> returns "a".
|
|-- string getContent()
|		Childs to string.
|
|
|
|-- void replaceWith(HTMLElement el)
|		Replace element. Useful when you don't want change all references to 
|		object.
|
|-- void removeChild(HTMLElement child, bool end_tag_too = true)
|		Removes given subelement. Element is specified by reference, not by
|		value, so it always removes only one element!
|
`--		end_tag_too specifies if endtag shoud be removed too. Default true.




= Creating DOM =
	If you want to create DOM from HTMLElements, you can use one of theese 
	constructors:

	HTMLElement()
		Blank element.
	
	HTMLElement("<tag>")
		From string containing tag (only one tag).
	
	HTMLElement("<tag>", {"param":"value"})
		Tag (with or without <>) with parameters defined by dictionary.
	
	These constructors are useful for creating documents:
	
		With specified tag, params and childs:

		HTMLElement(
			"tag",
			{"param":"value"}, 
			[
				HTMLElement("<tag1>"), 
				HTMLElement("<tag2>"),
				...
			]
		)

		With specified tag and childs:
		
		HTMLElement(
			"tag",
			[
				HTMLElement("<tag1>"),
				HTMLElement("<tag2>"),
				...
			]
		)

		With speicifed childs. Usefull for containers:
		
		HTMLElement(
			[
				HTMLElement("<tag1>"),
				HTMLElement("<tag2>"),
				...
			]
		)
