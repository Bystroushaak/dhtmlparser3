What is it?
===========
DHTMLParser is a lightweight HTML/XML parser created for one purpose - quick and easy 
picking selected tags from DOM.

It can be very useful when you are in need to write own "guerilla" API for some webpage, or a scrapper.

If you want, you can also create HTML/XML documents more easily than by joining strings.
